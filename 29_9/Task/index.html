          As part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes,

          twice,
          and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.
          She was also the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.
          She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire.
          She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.
          In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher
          degrees
          and conducted her subsequent scientific work.

            born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler (November 9, 1914 – January 19, 2000),
            was an Austrian-American actress, inventor, and film producer.
            She was part of 30 films in an acting career spanning 28 years,
            and co-invented an early version of frequency-hopping spread spectrum.

            Lamarr was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, and acted in a number of Austrian,
            German, and Czech films in her brief early film career, including the controversial Ecstasy (1933).
            In 1937, she fled from her husband, a wealthy Austrian ammunition manufacturer, secretly moving to Paris and
            then
            onward to London.
            There she met Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio,
            who offered her a movie contract in Hollywood, where he began promoting her as "the world's most beautiful
            woman".
